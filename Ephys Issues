1. Vibratome E0.501 error

The manual describes E0.5xx errors as being related to the light barrier inside the vibratome, and suggest turning off and calling a Leica technician.
Dan Gill found this youtube video ( ) which provides instructions for how to correct the error.
This should be tried before calling a Leica technician, but do not perform fixes beyond those that are strightforward, as it could void the warranty on the vibratome.


2. Vibratome E0.103 (E0.1xx) error

The manual says that E0.1xx errors relate to jammed buttons and switches. We generally get this error when turning the vibratome on. Check to make sure none of the buttons and switches are activated while turning the vibratome on.
